## Manual installation

If you wish to manually install UI3 (maybe to get a bugfix without waiting for it to arrive in a Blue Iris update), you can get it from the releases tab: https://github.com/bp2008/ui3/releases

To install, just extract everything to Blue Iris's `www` directory and overwrite all files.  The default path to this folder is `C:\Program Files\Blue Iris 5\www`.

### Blue Iris 4.x Users

Blue Iris 4.8.6.3 shipped with [UI3-70](https://github.com/bp2008/ui3/releases/tag/70), but you can update to [UI3-77](https://github.com/bp2008/ui3/releases/tag/77) for a few improvements.  Things will begin breaking if you update a Blue Iris 4.x installation beyond UI3-77.
