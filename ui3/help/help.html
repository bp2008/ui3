						<h2>UI3 Help Overview</h2>
						<p>Please choose a section from the navigation menu above.</p>
						<h2>Support</h2>
						<p>If you need support with UI3, the best place to go for help is <a href="https://ipcamtalk.com/forums/blue-iris.30/">the Blue Iris section of the IpCamTalk forum</a>.</p>
						<p>This interface was developed by community member <a target="_blank" href="https://ipcamtalk.com/members/bp2008.28/">bp2008</a> from <a href="https://ipcamtalk.com/">IpCamTalk</a>.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="tab-pane" id="videoplayer" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-videoplayer">
						<h1>Video Player</h1>
						<p class="bg-info padded-info"><b>Troubleshooting Tip</b><br /><br />If you experience choppy audio in UI3, or have trouble playing clips that were recorded in the MP4 format, try installing the <b>K-Lite Codec Pack</b> on your <b>Blue Iris server</b>.  Beware of bundled adware when installing any codec pack.  You can safely and conveniently get K-Lite Codecs from <b><a href="https://ninite.com/">ninite.com</a></b>.</p>
						<h2>Audio Streaming</h2>
						<p>UI3 supports one-way audio streaming from Blue Iris to UI3.  Audio playback is only available when streaming H.264 video, due to the streaming methods used.</p>
						<h2>Video Codecs <small>(Streaming Quality)</small></h2>
						<p>UI3 can stream video using two different compression methods: <b>H.264</b> and <b>Jpeg</b>.  H.264 is more efficient with network bandwidth, and usually achieves a higher frame rate, making it the most desirable choice in most circumstances.  H.264 is the default streaming method in browsers which support it.  Jpeg streaming is simpler and can be used in all browsers capable of running UI3.</p>
						<h3>H.264</h3>
						<p>UI3 can stream H.264 video if your browser supports it.  You can check for H.264 compatibility by looking in the Streaming Quality dropdown list.  If the only options there are "Jpeg" then your browser is not compatible.  If H.264 is available, it often provides a much smoother video stream.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If your viewing device has insufficient CPU or network speed, H.264 video will become increasingly delayed.  If this happens, UI3 will warn you and suggest that you try a different Streaming Quality option.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>H.264 Streaming Profiles</h3>
						<h4>Server-side profiles</h4>
						<p>Blue Iris provides three streaming profiles called simply "Streaming 0", "Streaming 1", and "Streaming 2".  To find these in Blue Iris's local console, open <b>Blue Iris Options</b> &gt; <b>Web server</b> tab &gt; <b>Advanced</b>.  Here, you can <b>configure</b> each of the encoder profiles.</p>
						<p class="bg-info padded-info">The three H.264 encoder profiles are shared between Blue Iris's mobile apps, UI3, and even the legacy default.htm and jpegpull.htm pages.</p>
						<h4>Client-side profiles</h4>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-sm-5">
								<p>Prior to June 2018, UI3 simply exposed the three server-side profiles as choices in the Streaming Quality menu, and that was that.</p>
								<p>Thanks to improvements in Blue Iris, UI3 is now able to provide more-intuitive quality choices such as "1080p", "720p", and "480p".  These quality choices each represent a fully-configurable streaming profile, which you can edit by opening the <a href="#mainmenu">Main Menu</a> and choosing the <b>Streaming Profiles</b> option.</p>
								<p>Each of UI3's streaming profiles must be based on one of the server-side profiles.  All encoding parameters are inherited from this profile unless otherwise specified in UI3.  UI3's default profiles are all based on <b>Streaming 0</b>, but they override the <b>Max Frame Width</b>, <b>Max Frame Height</b>, and <b>Max Bit Rate</b> parameters.  Other parameters, such as <b>Quality</b>, are intentionally left blank so their values will be inherited from <b>Streaming 0</b>.</p>
								<p>UI3 no longer includes <b>Streaming 0</b> or <b>Streaming 1</b> or <b>Streaming 2</b> as default quality choices.  If they are desired, they can be restored easily.  Simply create a new profile in UI3, give it a name, and base it on the desired server-side profile. Leave all the encoding parameters alone, and their values will be inherited from your chosen <b>Base Server Profile</b>.</p>
								<p class="bg-info padded-info">If you want to share your profile changes with all browsers and devices, <a href="#extensions">see the "Quick Start" section of UI Extensions</a>.</p>

						<h3>H.264 Profile Configuration Tips</h3>
						<h4>Audio</h4>
						<p>The audio codec setting has no effect on UI3.  UI3 only knows how to decode "mu-law" and that is what Blue Iris provides no matter what you set here.  It is therefore not an option in UI3's streaming profile system, but can be configured in Blue Iris's server-side profiles.</p>
						<h4>Quality vs Bit Rate</h4>
						<p>Blue Iris will encode up to your specified <b>Quality</b> level, automatically reducing quality if necessary to stay within the bit rate limit. For streaming, it is recommended to always use the <b>Limit bitrate</b> setting, otherwise the actual bit rate can get excessively high and in extreme cases this can cause decoding errors.</p>
						<p>The default quality value (50) is already quite high, so setting it higher is almost never a good idea for remote streaming!  Actually, lower values like 20 can provide enormous bandwidth savings while retaining acceptable visual quality.</p>
						<p>Lower bit rates work better with devices that have a slow CPU or slow network connection.</p>
						<h4>Maximum keyframe interval (GOP)</h4>
						<p>Also known as the i-frame interval.  For UI3, you should <b>set this as high as it goes</b> (300 at the time of this writing).</p>
						<h4>Maximum B-frames between P-frames</h4>
						<p>UI3 is not compatible with B-frames.  Keep this set to 0, though evidence suggests this setting has no effect anyway.</p>
						<h4>Advanced &gt; Profile</h4>
						<p>"high" profile is recommended for most users. "baseline" profile may reduce CPU requirements slightly at the cost of image quality.</p>
						<h4>Advanced &gt; Preset</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>"ultrafast" - Lowest CPU usage and lowest image quality</li>
							<li>"superfast" - A good balance between CPU usage and image quality</li>
							<li>"veryfast" - Slightly better image quality at the cost of higher CPU usage <b>and some video delay</b></li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Zero frame latency</h4>
						<p>Recommended to be enabled for best UI responsiveness. In testing, no perceptible difference was seen with this enabled or disabled.</p>
						<h4>Resize output frame width x height</h4>
						<p>This depends entirely on your personal preference for quality vs efficiency.  Lower resolutions are more efficient to work with.</p>
						<h3>Jpeg Streaming</h3>
						<p>Jpeg streaming is done by requesting Jpeg-compressed snapshots as quickly as possible.  It is not very efficient with network bandwidth and it can't achieve high frame rates over the internet.  However, being a simpler streaming method, it tends to "just work".  Jpeg streaming is capable of extremely high resolutions and excellent image quality.</p>
						<p class="bg-warning padded-info"><b>Audio playback</b> is <b>not available</b> while streaming Jpeg snapshots.</p>
						<h2>Context Menu</h2>
						<p>If you right click (long-press on touchscreens) on a camera, a context menu appears.  The first 4 actions are specific to the current video stream, while most other options are specific to the camera you clicked on.  Here, blue icons indicate actions that take effect on the Blue Iris server and require <span class="label label-primary">Admin</span> privilege, while black icons indicate actions that occur in the web UI.</p>

						<h1>HLS Streams</h1>
						<p>Blue Iris can stream any camera or group using the <abbr title="HTTP Live Stream">HLS</abbr> protocol.  Though it is not core functionality, UI3 provides the ability to consume these streams.</p>
						<p>HLS has significant video delay, but that is configurable to some extent in Blue Iris's streaming profile configuration.</p>
						<p>HLS streaming is only available for live video, but it works with individual cameras and groups alike.</p>
						<h2>Streaming with HLS in UI3</h2>
						<p>Right-click on any video stream and choose "Open HLS Stream".  A special video player called <a href="https://github.com/clappr/clappr">Clappr</a> will open in a dialog window.</p>
						<p class="bg-info padded-info">If you right-click the HLS player, you have the option to "Open stream in New Tab".  Opening an HLS stream in a new tab actually opens a different page called "livestream.htm".</p>
						<h2>livestream.htm</h2>
						<p>One of the pages included with UI3 is "livestream.htm" which just plays an HLS stream from Blue Iris and does basically nothing else.  The page takes a single URL parameter "cam" with the short name of the camera or group you wish to view.  Example: <a href="../../livestream.htm?cam=index">livestream.htm?cam=index</a></p>
						<p class="bg-info padded-info">If you omit the "cam" parameter, livestream.htm will attempt to load "index" (a.k.a. "all cameras" ).</p>

						<h1>Stats for Nerds</h1>
						<p>Inspired by YouTube's feature with the same name, UI3 has a "Stats for nerds" panel which shows an assortment of details about the video player.  This information can be useful for troubleshooting, but otherwise it is just fun to look at.</p>
						<p>To access this panel, right-click on UI3's video player and choose the "Stats for nerds" option.</p>

						<h1>UI Extensions</h1>
						<p>Experienced web developers can extend UI3 with custom JavaScript and CSS.</p>
						<p>Of course if you take the most obvious route and modify <code>ui3.js</code> and <code>ui3.css</code> files directly, you would have to re-apply your changes after every update! To solve this problem, UI3 attemps to load two files which do not exist in releases: <code>ui3-local-overrides.js</code> and <code>ui3-local-overrides.css</code>. You can create either or both of these files and place them in the "ui3" subdirectory of your Blue Iris installation's web root directory ("www").  These two files will be loaded after all the other script and style files, allowing you to conveniently override virtually any default functionality you wish, if you have the programming skills to do so.</p>
						<h2>Examples</h2>
						<p>For examples, see <a href="https://github.com/bp2008/ui3/wiki/Local-Overrides-Scripts-and-Styles">https://github.com/bp2008/ui3/wiki/Local-Overrides-Scripts-and-Styles</a></p>
						<h2>Quick Start <small>- Globally Override Default Settings</small></h2>
						<p>At the bottom of the UI Settings panel is an item called 'Create Script: "ui3-local-overrides.js"'.  This item is only visible if you have logged in to UI3 as a Blue Iris administrator.</p>
						<p>When you click the "Download" link, your browser should download a copy of your current settings in the form of a ui3-local-overrides.js file.  If you move this file into your "ui3" subdirectory, then all users will receive your current settings by default.</p>
						<p>If you want to customize the default values in this auto-generated file, you should first understand some things:</p>
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">
								If you manually edit a setting's value in the ui3-local-overrides.js script, you should also increment the Generation number.  Each user (each web browser, really) will only adopt your new default value if the Generation associated with it is a higher number than the generation they had previously.
								<br /><br />
								If you make the change in your own web browser and re-download the ui3-local-overrides.js file, this will automatically increment all generation numbers.  Then you just need to replace your old overrides file with the new one.
							</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">If you want your default value to ALWAYS be reloaded when UI3 is loaded, set "Always Reload" to true.  Then, the Generation number does not matter, and your specified value will take effect every time UI3 is loaded regardless of how each user has configured it.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">To prevent a setting from appearing in the UI Settings panel, change "true" to "false" for the "Options Window" parameter.  Uncategorized settings don't appear in the options window anyway, and some items from the UI Settings panel aren't settings in the first place, but buttons (e.g. to forget saved credentials).</li>
						</ul>

					<div class="tab-pane" id="cameralayout" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-cameralayout">
						<h1>Camera Layout</h1>
						<p>UI3 is unable to control your camera layout.  To change the camera layout, you must drag cameras around in Blue Iris's local console.</p>

						<p><img class="img-responsive" mysrc="img/GroupProperties.png" alt="Screenshot of Group Properties" /></p>

						<h1>Recordings</h1>
						<p>To view recorded video, you must use "Clips" tab at the top of the UI.</p>
						<h2>Alerts</h2>
						<p>The "Alerts" tab is gone since UI3-120.  "Alerts" is now one of many dropdown list items on the "Clips" tab.  A "Clip" represents a single video file on disk.  An "Alert" is a bookmark to a specific location in a clip.  A single clip may have multiple associated alerts, or no associated alerts.</p>
						<h2>Filters</h2>
						<p>You can filter the Clips list by camera, group, date, and database view ("All clips", "Alerts", "New", "Sentry confirmed", etc.).</p>
						<p>To filter by camera, simply maximize that camera by clicking on it in the main video area.  To filter by other criteria, use the filter controls above the Clip list.</p>
						<p><img class="img-responsive" mysrc="img/RecordingFilters.png" alt="Screenshot of recording filters" /></p>
						<h3>Expanding the Filters</h3>
						<p>If you don't see the filter controls, that means you have collapsed them by clicking on the "Filter Clips by:" text.  Click the "Filter Clips by:" text again to expand the filter controls section.</p>

						<h1>Exporting Video</h1>
						<p>Clips or sections of clips may be exported into MP4, AVI, or WMV formats and then downloaded through UI3.</p>
						<p>Exported items are kept on your Blue Iris server in the "New" folder as configured in Blue Iris settings, and the files will automatically be managed according to the rules assigned to that folder.  UI3 does not currently offer the ability to delete exported items manually, but you can do this from the Covert/Export queue in Blue Iris's local console.</p>
						<h3>Begin Exporting</h3>
						<p>To begin exporting clips, open the Convert/Export interface using one of these methods:</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Right-click a clip or alert, then choose <b>Convert/export</b></li>
								<li>Select multiple clips or alerts, then right-click one of them and choose <b>Convert/export</b></li>
								<li>Right-click the video player while a recording is open, then choose <b>Convert/export</b></li>
								<li>Click the Export button <img mysrc="img/ConvertExportIcon.png" alt="icon" style="height: 20px;" /> within the playback controls while a recording is open.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<h3>Configuring an Export Operation</h3>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-sm-7">
								<p>When you open the Convert/Export interface, you will be shown a panel with options related to the export operation.</p>
								<p>MP4 output format is recommended for best compatibility with 3rd-party applications.</p>
								<p>Encoder profiles used by the export feature cannot be edited in UI3.  This must be done in the local console of Blue Iris.</p>
								<p>To export a timelapse, disable the audio track and enable re-encoding video to H.264.</p>
								<p>
									If you are exporting a single clip, you may choose a specific time range to export. Drag the green and red knobs to your desired start and stop points:<br />
