						<h2>Support</h2>
						<p>If you need support with UI3, the best place to go for help is <a href="https://ipcamtalk.com/forums/blue-iris.30/">the Blue Iris section of the IpCamTalk forum</a>.</p>
						<p>This interface was developed by community member <a target="_blank" href="https://ipcamtalk.com/members/bp2008.28/">bp2008</a> from <a href="https://ipcamtalk.com/">IpCamTalk</a>.</p>

						<h1>Video Player</h1>
						<p class="bg-info padded-info"><b>Troubleshooting Tip</b><br /><br />If you experience choppy audio in UI3, or have trouble playing clips that were recorded in the MP4 format, try installing the <b>K-Lite Codec Pack</b> on your <b>Blue Iris server</b>.  Beware of bundled adware when installing any codec pack.  You can safely and conveniently get K-Lite Codecs from <b><a href="https://ninite.com/">ninite.com</a></b>.</p>
						<h2>Audio Streaming</h2>
						<p>UI3 supports one-way audio streaming from Blue Iris to UI3.  Audio playback is only available when streaming H.264 video, due to the streaming methods used.</p>
						<h2>Video Codecs <small>(Streaming Quality)</small></h2>
						<p>UI3 can stream video using two different compression methods: <b>H.264</b> and <b>Jpeg</b>.  H.264 is more efficient with network bandwidth, and usually achieves a higher frame rate, making it the most desirable choice in most circumstances.  H.264 is the default streaming method in browsers which support it.  Jpeg streaming is simpler and can be used in all browsers capable of running UI3.</p>
						<h3>H.264</h3>
						<p>UI3 can stream H.264 video if your browser supports it.  You can check for H.264 compatibility by looking in the Streaming Quality dropdown list.  If the only options there are "Jpeg" then your browser is not compatible.  If H.264 is available, it often provides a much smoother video stream.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If your viewing device has insufficient CPU or network speed, H.264 video will become increasingly delayed.  If this happens, UI3 will warn you and suggest that you try a different Streaming Quality option.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>H.264 Streaming Profiles</h3>
						<h4>Server-side profiles</h4>
						<p>Blue Iris provides three streaming profiles called simply "Streaming 0", "Streaming 1", and "Streaming 2".  To find these in Blue Iris's local console, open <b>Blue Iris Options</b> &gt; <b>Web server</b> tab &gt; <b>Advanced</b>.  Here, you can <b>configure</b> each of the encoder profiles.</p>
						<p class="bg-info padded-info">The three H.264 encoder profiles are shared between Blue Iris's mobile apps, UI3, and even the legacy default.htm and jpegpull.htm pages.</p>
						<h4>Client-side profiles</h4>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-sm-5">
								<p>Prior to June 2018, UI3 simply exposed the three server-side profiles as choices in the Streaming Quality menu, and that was that.</p>
								<p>Thanks to improvements in Blue Iris, UI3 is now able to provide more-intuitive quality choices such as "1080p", "720p", and "480p".  These quality choices each represent a fully-configurable streaming profile, which you can edit by opening the <a href="#mainmenu">Main Menu</a> and choosing the <b>Streaming Profiles</b> option.</p>
								<p>Each of UI3's streaming profiles must be based on one of the server-side profiles.  All encoding parameters are inherited from this profile unless otherwise specified in UI3.  UI3's default profiles are all based on <b>Streaming 0</b>, but they override the <b>Max Frame Width</b>, <b>Max Frame Height</b>, and <b>Max Bit Rate</b> parameters.  Other parameters, such as <b>Quality</b>, are intentionally left blank so their values will be inherited from <b>Streaming 0</b>.</p>
								<p>UI3 no longer includes <b>Streaming 0</b> or <b>Streaming 1</b> or <b>Streaming 2</b> as default quality choices.  If they are desired, they can be restored easily.  Simply create a new profile in UI3, give it a name, and base it on the desired server-side profile. Leave all the encoding parameters alone, and their values will be inherited from your chosen <b>Base Server Profile</b>.</p>
								<p class="bg-info padded-info">If you want to share your profile changes with all browsers and devices, <a href="#extensions">see the "Quick Start" section of UI Extensions</a>.</p>

						<h3>H.264 Profile Configuration Tips</h3>
						<h4>Audio</h4>
						<p>The audio codec setting has no effect on UI3.  UI3 only knows how to decode "mu-law" and that is what Blue Iris provides no matter what you set here.  It is therefore not an option in UI3's streaming profile system, but can be configured in Blue Iris's server-side profiles.</p>
						<h4>Quality vs Bit Rate</h4>
						<p>Blue Iris will encode up to your specified <b>Quality</b> level, automatically reducing quality if necessary to stay within the bit rate limit. For streaming, it is recommended to always use the <b>Limit bitrate</b> setting, otherwise the actual bit rate can get excessively high and in extreme cases this can cause decoding errors.</p>
						<p>The default quality value (50) is already quite high, so setting it higher is almost never a good idea for remote streaming!  Actually, lower values like 20 can provide enormous bandwidth savings while retaining acceptable visual quality.</p>
						<p>Lower bit rates work better with devices that have a slow CPU or slow network connection.</p>
						<h4>Maximum keyframe interval (GOP)</h4>
						<p>Also known as the i-frame interval.  For UI3, you should <b>set this as high as it goes</b> (300 at the time of this writing).</p>
						<h4>Maximum B-frames between P-frames</h4>
						<p>UI3 is not compatible with B-frames.  Keep this set to 0, though evidence suggests this setting has no effect anyway.</p>
						<h4>Advanced &gt; Profile</h4>
						<p>"high" profile is recommended for most users. "baseline" profile may reduce CPU requirements slightly at the cost of image quality.</p>
						<h4>Advanced &gt; Preset</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>"ultrafast" - Lowest CPU usage and lowest image quality</li>
							<li>"superfast" - A good balance between CPU usage and image quality</li>
							<li>"veryfast" - Slightly better image quality at the cost of higher CPU usage <b>and some video delay</b></li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Zero frame latency</h4>
						<p>Recommended to be enabled for best UI responsiveness. In testing, no perceptible difference was seen with this enabled or disabled.</p>
						<h4>Resize output frame width x height</h4>
						<p>This depends entirely on your personal preference for quality vs efficiency.  Lower resolutions are more efficient to work with.</p>
						<h3>Jpeg Streaming</h3>
						<p>Jpeg streaming is done by requesting Jpeg-compressed snapshots as quickly as possible.  It is not very efficient with network bandwidth and it can't achieve high frame rates over the internet.  However, being a simpler streaming method, it tends to "just work".  Jpeg streaming is capable of extremely high resolutions and excellent image quality.</p>
						<p class="bg-warning padded-info"><b>Audio playback</b> is <b>not available</b> while streaming Jpeg snapshots.</p>
						<h2>Context Menu</h2>
						<p>If you right click (long-press on touchscreens) on a camera, a context menu appears.  The first 4 actions are specific to the current video stream, while most other options are specific to the camera you clicked on.  Here, blue icons indicate actions that take effect on the Blue Iris server and require <span class="label label-primary">Admin</span> privilege, while black icons indicate actions that occur in the web UI.</p>

						<h1>HLS Streams</h1>
						<p>Blue Iris can stream any camera or group using the <abbr title="HTTP Live Stream">HLS</abbr> protocol.  Though it is not core functionality, UI3 provides the ability to consume these streams.</p>
						<p>HLS has significant video delay, but that is configurable to some extent in Blue Iris's streaming profile configuration.</p>
						<p>HLS streaming is only available for live video, but it works with individual cameras and groups alike.</p>
						<h2>Streaming with HLS in UI3</h2>
						<p>Right-click on any video stream and choose "Open HLS Stream".  A special video player called <a href="https://github.com/clappr/clappr">Clappr</a> will open in a dialog window.</p>
						<p class="bg-info padded-info">If you right-click the HLS player, you have the option to "Open stream in New Tab".  Opening an HLS stream in a new tab actually opens a different page called "livestream.htm".</p>
						<h2>livestream.htm</h2>
						<p>One of the pages included with UI3 is "livestream.htm" which just plays an HLS stream from Blue Iris and does basically nothing else.  The page takes a single URL parameter "cam" with the short name of the camera or group you wish to view.  Example: <a href="../../livestream.htm?cam=index">livestream.htm?cam=index</a></p>
						<p class="bg-info padded-info">If you omit the "cam" parameter, livestream.htm will attempt to load "index" (a.k.a. "all cameras" ).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="tab-pane" id="ptzcontrols" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-ptzcontrols">
						<h1>PTZ Controls</h1>
						<p>UI3 offers several methods of controlling Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras.  For correct behavior, each camera must have the appropriate PTZ control profile chosen in Blue Iris.  Not all cameras support all functions that are shown in the user interface.</p>
						<h3>Standard PTZ Controls</h3>
						<p>The primary method of PTZ input is via the PTZ button pad on the Live View tab, where buttons are available to pan, tilt, zoom, or adjust camera focus.  Mouse over each button for a description of what each button does.  The button at the center of the button pad is to "Stop" the camera, which is unnecessary in most cases but may be helpful if your camera is stuck in a moving state and the other buttons cannot stop it.</p>
						<h3>Preset Positions</h3>
						<p>Below the PTZ button pad, there are buttons for loading and setting PTZ presets.</p>
						<h4>Goto Preset</h4>
						<p>Click a button to instruct the camera to go to that preset position.</p>
						<h4>Set Preset</h4>
						<p>Long-press (click and hold) a button to set the preset to the camera's current position.  You will be prompted to enter a name for the preset, and given the option to cancel the "Set" operation.  If you proceed, the camera will be instructed to save the preset, and Blue Iris save a snapshot of the current view to show within the preset button.</p>
						<p>If long-press doesn't work, you can access the "Set" functionality by right clicking each preset button to open a context menu.</p>
						<h4>Mouseover</h4>
						<p>Mousing over any preset button will show the name assigned to the preset, along with the saved snapshot.</p>
						<h3>3D Positioning</h3>
						<p>On supported cameras, the "Toggle 3D Positioning" button can be used to enable 3D Positioning mode, where you can click a spot in the camera's field of view and the camera will attempt to center its view on that position.</p>
						<p>If you click and drag, you can draw a rectangle around the region you would like the camera to move to.  Drag <b>left-to-right</b> to draw a red rectangle that will cause the camera to <b>zoom in</b>.  Drag <b>right-to-left</b> to draw a blue rectangle that will cause the camera to <b>zoom out</b>.</p>
						<p>For devices with a keyboard, you can hold the CTRL key to temporarily enable "3D Positioning" mode, even when not on the Live View tab.  <i>(TIP: the CTRL key + click method is also supported in Blue Iris's local console for basic 3D positioning.)</i></p>
						<p>For devices with a mouse wheel, you can click with the mouse wheel instead of the primary mouse button to directly access "3D Positioning" mode without explicitly enabling it and without using the CTRL key.</p>
						<p><i>* At this time, UI3 does not support 3D Positioning while viewing a camera group, only when viewing an individual camera.</i></p>
						<p class="bg-info padded-info"><b>3D Positioning Compatibility</b><br /><br />If you know that your camera supports 3D positioning in its web interface, but you can't make it work in Blue Iris or in UI3, try selecting a different PTZ control profile for the camera in Blue Iris.  Blue Iris has multiple choices of PTZ protocol for some popular camera manufacturers, such as Dahua.<br /><br />As of Blue Iris 5.5.6.18, 3D positioning with zoom capability is supported with the "Dahua New V4" PTZ profile.  Other PTZ profiles may offer limited or no support for 3D positioning.<br /><br />3D Positioning support may change with Blue Iris updates and with camera firmware updates.<br /><br />If none of the relevant PTZ profiles enable 3D Positioning with your camera, but you know your camera is capable of 3D positioning, Blue Iris Support may be able to help (requires an active support plan).</p>
						<h3>Hotkeys</h3>
						<p>Hotkeys exist for most PTZ functions, and hotkeys work even if you are not on the Live View tab.  With a default hotkey configuration, try the arrow keys to pan and tilt, <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> keys on the number bar to zoom, and <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> keys to adjust focus.  The number keys 0-9 on the number bar are bound to goto PTZ presets.  Holding the CTRL key will temporarily activate "3D Positioning" mode (see "3D Positioning" section above).</p>

						<h1>Stats for Nerds</h1>
						<p>Inspired by YouTube's feature with the same name, UI3 has a "Stats for nerds" panel which shows an assortment of details about the video player.  This information can be useful for troubleshooting, but otherwise it is just fun to look at.</p>
						<p>To access this panel, right-click on UI3's video player and choose the "Stats for nerds" option.</p>

						<h1>UI Extensions</h1>
						<p>Experienced web developers can extend UI3 with custom JavaScript and CSS.</p>
						<p>Of course if you take the most obvious route and modify <code>ui3.js</code> and <code>ui3.css</code> files directly, you would have to re-apply your changes after every update! To solve this problem, UI3 attemps to load two files which do not exist in releases: <code>ui3-local-overrides.js</code> and <code>ui3-local-overrides.css</code>. You can create either or both of these files and place them in the "ui3" subdirectory of your Blue Iris installation's web root directory ("www").  These two files will be loaded after all the other script and style files, allowing you to conveniently override virtually any default functionality you wish, if you have the programming skills to do so.</p>
						<h2>Examples</h2>
						<p>For examples, see <a href="https://github.com/bp2008/ui3/wiki/Local-Overrides-Scripts-and-Styles">https://github.com/bp2008/ui3/wiki/Local-Overrides-Scripts-and-Styles</a></p>
						<h2>Quick Start <small>- Globally Override Default Settings</small></h2>
						<p>At the bottom of the UI Settings panel is an item called 'Create Script: "ui3-local-overrides.js"'.  This item is only visible if you have logged in to UI3 as a Blue Iris administrator.</p>
						<p>When you click the "Download" link, your browser should download a copy of your current settings in the form of a ui3-local-overrides.js file.  If you move this file into your "ui3" subdirectory, then all users will receive your current settings by default.</p>
						<p>If you want to customize the default values in this auto-generated file, you should first understand some things:</p>
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">
								If you manually edit a setting's value in the ui3-local-overrides.js script, you should also increment the Generation number.  Each user (each web browser, really) will only adopt your new default value if the Generation associated with it is a higher number than the generation they had previously.
								<br /><br />
								If you make the change in your own web browser and re-download the ui3-local-overrides.js file, this will automatically increment all generation numbers.  Then you just need to replace your old overrides file with the new one.
							</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">If you want your default value to ALWAYS be reloaded when UI3 is loaded, set "Always Reload" to true.  Then, the Generation number does not matter, and your specified value will take effect every time UI3 is loaded regardless of how each user has configured it.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">To prevent a setting from appearing in the UI Settings panel, change "true" to "false" for the "Options Window" parameter.  Uncategorized settings don't appear in the options window anyway, and some items from the UI Settings panel aren't settings in the first place, but buttons (e.g. to forget saved credentials).</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="tab-pane" id="cameralayout" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-cameralayout">
						<h1>Camera Layout</h1>
						<p>UI3 is unable to directly control the order or exact positioning of your cameras.  To change the order of your cameras, you must enter "Edit Layout" mode in Blue Iris's local console, and drag cameras around.</p>
						<h2>Optimizing Group Frames</h2>
						<p>Since Blue Iris 5.5, group video streams have a dynamic resolution intended to best-fit within the viewport you have available.  If you wish to adjust this behavior, there are a few ways to do it:</p>
						<h3>In UI3</h3>
						<p>
							Right-click the group video in UI3, and choose "Group Settings".  Here, you can force a specific aspect ratio for the group frame, adjust the streaming resolution limit to improve quality or save CPU cycles, or toggle features like the camera labels and borders.  Control of the group frame's aspect ratio will be unavailable if you have configured a fixed aspect ratio for the group within Blue Iris's local console.
						</p>
						<h3>In the Blue Iris Local Console</h3>
						<p>
							In the local console, choose the desired group and click the "Edit Layout" button to the right of the group selection dropdown list.  Then, right click any camera to access a menu of options to configure the group layout.  Most options here also affect UI3.  You can also click and drag cameras to reposition them.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="tab-pane" id="recordings" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-recordings">
						<h1>Recordings</h1>
						<p>To view recorded video, you must use "Clips" tab at the top of the UI.</p>
						<h2>Alerts</h2>
						<p>The "Alerts" tab is gone since UI3-120.  "Alerts" is now one of many dropdown list items on the "Clips" tab.  A "Clip" represents a single video file on disk.  An "Alert" is a bookmark to a specific location in a clip.  A single clip may have multiple associated alerts, or no associated alerts.</p>
						<h2>Filters</h2>
						<p>You can filter the Clips list by camera, group, date, and database view ("All clips", "Alerts", "New", "Sentry confirmed", etc.).</p>
						<p>To filter by camera, simply maximize that camera by clicking on it in the main video area.  To filter by other criteria, use the filter controls above the Clip list.</p>
						<p><img class="img-responsive" mysrc="img/RecordingFilters.png" alt="Screenshot of recording filters" /></p>

						<p>If you don't see the filter controls, that means you have collapsed them by clicking on the "Filter Clips by:" text.  Click the "Filter Clips by:" text again to expand the filter controls section.</p>

						<h1>MQTT Remote Control</h1>
						<p>Since UI3-216, MQTT can be configured as a communication channel to remotely control UI3 instances.  MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging system commonly used in home automation.</p>
						<h3>Prerequisite</h3>
						<p>To use MQTT in UI3, you must first have access to an MQTT broker with WebSocket support, such as <a href="https://mosquitto.org/">Eclipse Mosquitto™</a> software.  Mosquitto is commonly installed as an addon to the popular Home Assistant OS running on a raspberry pi or a virtual machine or docker container, but the Mosquitto server can also be installed on Windows if desired.  Installing and configuring an MQTT broker is outside the scope of this document.</p>
						<h3>UI3 Configuration</h3>
						<p>Go to UI3's Main Menu > UI Settings > MQTT Remote Control section and fill in the WebSocket URL, User Name, and Password fields.  Adjust the Instance ID if you desire (it is randomly generated, but can be edited).  For basic users, the  MQTT Advanced options should be left at their default values.  When ready, enable the MQTT Client via the toggle button labelled "Enable MQTT Client".  Toast messages should quickly appear indicating success or failure of the connection to the MQTT broker.</p>
						<p class="bg-info padded-info"><b>What are WebSocket URLs?</b><br /><br />WebSocket URLs are very similar to regular web URLs, except instead of beginning with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>, they begin with <code>ws://</code> for unencrypted connections, or <code>wss://</code> for connections that will be secured with TLS.<br /><br />An example WebSocket URL is <code>ws://homeassistant.local:1884/</code> which indicates that the connection should use an unencrypted connection to the host named <code>homeassistant.local</code> on TCP port <code>1884</code>.</p>
						<h3>Remote Functions</h3>
						<p>You can use UI3's MQTT Remote Control capabilities to change the current live group or camera, maximize or unmaximize the video player, and change the volume of audio streaming.</p>
						<div class="panel panel-info">
							<div class="panel-heading">List of MQTT topics used by UI3</div>
							<div class="panel-body">
								<dl class="dl-vertical">
									<dt>ui3/instance_id/state/vid</dt>
									<dd>The group name or camera short name currently being live-viewed.</dd>
									<dt>ui3/instance_id/state/maximize</dt>
									<dd><code>0</code> or <code>1</code> to indicate whether the UI is maximized.</dd>
									<dt>ui3/instance_id/state/volume</dt>
									<dd> Audio playback volume from <code>0</code> to <code>100</code> (for the video player's volume control).</dd>
								</dl>
							</div><!--/.panel-body -->
						</div><!--/.panel -->
						<p>Note the <code>instance_id</code> text in the MQTT topic list above.  <code>instance_id</code> is placeholder text which must be replaced by the Instance ID as configured in UI Settings.  It is this Instance ID which enables you to individually target specific UI3 instances when multiple UI3 instances are connected to the same MQTT broker.  The Instance ID is randomly generated by each web browser you run UI3 in, but it can be modified manually if desired.  It is saved in the browser's Local Storage along with all other UI settings.</p>
						<p>UI3 subscribes to these topics with its own Instance ID, and reacts when other MQTT clients publish messages to them.</p>
						<p>UI3 also publishes messages to these topics when the local state changes due to user-interaction, so that other MQTT clients can subscribe to them to learn the current state of the UI3 instance.  This behavior coincidentally allows a UI3 instance to remotely control another UI3 instance if they are both connected to the same MQTT broker, and both have the same Instance ID assigned.</p>
						<h3>Tips</h3>
						<p>If you have trouble understanding how MQTT works, I suggest using <a href="http://mqtt-explorer.com/">MQTT Explorer</a> to view the activity on your MQTT broker in real-time.  This will enable you to easily see what UI3 is doing with MQTT topics.  The tool can also publish messages so you can use it to test UI3's remote control capability.</p>
						<p>The "All cameras" group is not actually named <code>All cameras</code>. This group is internally named <code>Index</code> and must be referred to as such for remote control purposes.</p>
						<p>The <code>vid</code> topic is only used for live viewing at this time, but may be extended in the future to support timeline playback or clips/alerts.</p>
						<p>It is recommended when publishing MQTT messages to UI3, that you always use the "retain" flag.  This provides the most consistent and predictable behavior.</p>
						<h3>Advanced Configuration</h3>
						<p>UI3 offers several advanced options for its MQTT client.</p>
						<p>By default, UI3 performs two-way communication with the MQTT broker, both publishing its own status changes and subscribing to receive status changes from the broker. You can individually toggle the publish and subscribe functions in order to have the remote control work only one-way.</p>
						<p>MQTT supports 3 different "QOS" values (0, 1, 2) for subscribing and for publishing.  Non-zero QOS values attempt to offer additional guarantees of message delivery, but for most users, QOS 0 is sufficient and it is the fastest option.  Advanced users may choose different QOS values individually for publishing and subscribing.</p>
						<p>By default, UI3 publishes its state messages with the "Retain" flag set in order to help persist the UI state between page loads.  If desired, you can turn this off.</p>
					</div><!--/.tab-pane -->
					<div class="tab-pane" id="export" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-export">
						<h1>Exporting Video</h1>
						<p>Clips or sections of clips may be exported into MP4, AVI, or WMV formats and then downloaded through UI3.</p>
						<p>Exported items are kept on your Blue Iris server in the "New" folder as configured in Blue Iris settings, and the files will automatically be managed according to the rules assigned to that folder.  UI3 does not currently offer the ability to delete exported items manually, but you can do this from the Covert/Export queue in Blue Iris's local console.</p>
						<h3>Begin Exporting</h3>
						<p>To begin exporting clips, open the Convert/Export interface using one of these methods:</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Right-click a clip or alert, then choose <b>Convert/export</b></li>
								<li>Select multiple clips or alerts, then right-click one of them and choose <b>Convert/export</b></li>
								<li>Right-click the video player while a recording is open, then choose <b>Convert/export</b></li>
								<li>Click the Export button <img mysrc="img/ConvertExportIcon.png" alt="icon" style="height: 20px;" /> within the playback controls while a recording is open.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<h3>Configuring an Export Operation</h3>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-sm-7">
								<p>When you open the Convert/Export interface, you will be shown a panel with options related to the export operation.</p>
								<p>MP4 output format is recommended for best compatibility with 3rd-party applications.</p>
								<p>Encoder profiles used by the export feature cannot be edited in UI3.  This must be done in the local console of Blue Iris.</p>
								<p>To export a timelapse, disable the audio track and enable re-encoding video to H.264.</p>
								<p>
									If you are exporting a single clip, you may choose a specific time range to export. Drag the green and red knobs to your desired start and stop points:<br />
