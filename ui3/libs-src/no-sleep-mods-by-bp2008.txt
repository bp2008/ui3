I determined https://github.com/sgilroy/no-sleep/ to be the best fork of no-sleep.
I downloaded it, modified it:

* to support circumventing autoplay-disabling addons
* and to create the window.NoSleep object
* and to build with "babel" targeting ES5 to be compatible with IE9
  * that required using "tsup" instead of "vite" to do the build.

And then I built it:

```
npm install
npm run build:legacy
```

The current release was not minified with closure-compiler-v20250706.jar, but that is an option.

Build output and source code (7z) are in the same directory as this file.
